#+Title: emacs-config
* Introduction
This is my personal setup for emacs. At a high level, it is separated into the sourced file (.emacs) and the actual configuration config.org which is rendered into elisp.

Currently, it is a large work in progress, but at a high level it is define by vim bindings (evil) and python based development
** Context
Currently, I have emacs running in Windows (yes, gross), but the intent is to build config which will work seamlessly between linux and windows developer environments. Historically, I have used emacs server to run remotely on linux and then x11 or nomachine with emacsclient to connect and forward back to my local machine
** Current priorities
Current priorities are creating development environments for python, Rust, and C++, specifically using tree-sitter
